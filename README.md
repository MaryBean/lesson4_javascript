### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. JavaScript is a client side scripting language, or rather it is executed in the software the viewer is using. 
2. JavaScript and Java are two completely different languages, they are NOT the same. 
3. There are two ways to add JavaScript to web pages. You can either embed the Java Script tag in HTML code, or you can embed JavaScript in an external file.
